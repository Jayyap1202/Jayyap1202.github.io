                    <p id="history_text">There were conflicting versions of how Terengganu got her name. Some correlated
                        it to the finding
                        of
                        a canine tooth of an unknown origin at a river estuary by a group of hunters from a neighbouring
                        state. So it was said that the place they went hunting where the “Taring Anu” was found. Some
                        believed the name derived from a very bright rainbow (ganu) seen by a group of travellers and
                        proclaimed the land to be “Terang Ganu” (Bright Rainbow). Furthermore the name Terengganu was
                        mentioned as Teng-Ya-Nu by a Chinese scholar, Coo-Cu-Fei in his book Ling Wai Fai Ta in 1178AD.
                        Another Chinese historian, Cao – Ju- Kua did not miss Teng – ya - nung when he authored Cu Fan
                        Cih
                        in 1226AD.

                        cultural
                        influences predominate. Traditional pursuits such as kite-flying contests, top-spinning
                        contests, wayang kulit and traditional arts & crafts, such as batik and songket are still
                        very
                        much alive. The people of Terengganu have always had a reputation for being socially
                        conservative and devout Muslims.
